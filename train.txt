however  many  atheists  would  reluctant  state  certainty  universe  exists  faith  also  used  refer  belief  without  supporting  evidence  proof  sceptical  atheism  certainly  fit  definition

attitudes  towards  theists  fact  cover  broad  spectrum  atheists  take  live  let  live  attitude  unless  questioned  usually  mention  atheism  except  perhaps  close  friends  course  may  part  atheism  socially  acceptable  many  countries  atheists  quite  anti  religious  may  even  try  convert  others  possible  historically  anti  religious  atheists  made  little  impact  society

careful  confuse  valid  arguments  sound  arguments  delve  structure  logical  arguments  would  require  lengthy  discussion  linguistics  philosophy  simpler  probably  useful  summarize  major  pitfalls  avoided  constructing  argument  pitfalls  known  fallacies  everyday  english  term  fallacy  used  refer  mistaken  beliefs  well  faulty  reasoning  leads  beliefs  fair  enough  logic  term  generally  used  refer  form  technically  incorrect  argument  especially  argument  appears  valid  convincing  purposes  discussion  define  fallacy  logical  argument  appears  correct  seen  incorrect  examined  closely  studying  fallacies  aim  avoid  misled  following  list  fallacies  intended  exhaustive  argumentum  ad  baculum  appeal  force  appeal  force  committed  arguer  resorts  force  threat  force  order  try  push  acceptance  conclusion  often  used  politicians  summarized  might  makes  right  force  threatened  need  direct  threat  arguer  example  thus  ample  proof  truth  bible  refuse  accept  truth  burn  hell  argumentum  ad  hominem  argumentum  ad  hominem  literally  argument  directed  man  abusive  variety  argumentum  ad  hominem  occurs  instead  trying  disprove  truth  assertion  arguer  attacks  person  people  making  assertion  invalid  truth  assertion  depend  upon  goodness  asserting  example  atheism  evil  philosophy  practised  communists  murderers  sometimes  court  law  doubt  cast  upon  testimony  witness  showing  example  known  perjurer  valid  way  reducing  credibility  testimony  given  witness  argumentum  ad  hominem  however  demonstrate  witness  testimony  false  conclude  otherwise  fall  victim  argumentum  ad  ignorantiam  see  elsewhere  list  circumstantial  form  argumentum  ad  hominem  committed  person  argues  opponent  ought  accept  truth  assertion  opponent  particular  circumstances  example  perfectly  acceptable  kill  animals  food  argue  otherwise  quite  happy  wear  leather  shoes  abusive  charge  inconsistency  used  excuse  dismissing  opponent  argument  fallacy  also  used  means  rejecting  conclusion  example  course  would  argue  positive  discrimination  bad  thing  white  particular  form  argumentum  ad  hominem  one  alleges  one  adversary  rationalizing  conclusion  formed  selfish  interests  also  known  poisoning  well  argumentum  ad  ignorantium  argumentum  ad  ignorantium  means  argument  ignorance  fallacy  occurs  whenever  argued  something  must  true  simply  proved  false  equivalently  argued  something  must  false  proved  true  note  assuming  something  false  proved  true  basic  scientific  principle  examples  course  bible  true  nobody  prove  otherwise  course  telepathy  psychic  phenomena  exist  nobody  shown  proof  real  note  fallacy  apply  court  law  one  generally  assumed  innocent  proven  guilty  also  scientific  investigation  known  event  would  produce  certain  evidence  occurred  absence  evidence  validly  used  infer  event  occur  example  flood  described  bible  would  require  enormous  volume  water  present  earth  earth  tenth  much  water  even  count  frozen  ice  poles  therefore  flood  occurred  science  validly  assume  lack  evidence  something  occurred  cannot  conclude  certainty  occurred  however  argumentum  ad  misericordiam  appeal  pity  also  known  special  pleading  fallacy  committed  arguer  appeals  pity  sake  getting  conclusion  accepted  example  murder  mother  father  axe  please  find  guilty  suffering  enough  orphan  argumentum  ad  populum  known  appealing  gallery  appealing  people  commit  fallacy  attempt  win  acceptance  assertion  appealing  large  group  people  form  fallacy  often  characterized  emotive  language  example  pornography  must  banned  violence  women  bible  must  true  millions  people  know  trying  tell  mistaken  fools  argumentum  ad  numeram  fallacy  closely  related  argumentum  ad  populum  consists  asserting  people  support  believe  proposition  likely  proposition  correct  argumentum  ad  verecundiam  appeal  authority  uses  admiration  famous  try  win  support  assertion  example  isaac  newton  genius  believed  god  line  argument  always  completely  bogus  example  reference  admitted  authority  particular  field  may  relevant  discussion    example  distinguish  quite  clearly  stephen  hawking  concluded  black  holes  give  radiation  john  searle  concluded  impossible  build  intelligent  computer  hawking  physicist  reasonably  expect  opinions  black  hole  radiation  informed  searle  linguist  questionable  whether  well  qualified  speak    machine  intelligence  fallacy  accident  fallacy  accident  committed  general  rule  applied  particular  case  whose  accidental  circumstances  mean  rule  inapplicable  error  made  one  goes  general  specific  example  christians  generally  dislike  atheists  christian  must  dislike  atheists  fallacy  often  committed  moralists  legalists  try  decide  every  moral  legal  question  mechanically  applying  general  rules  converse  accident  hasty  generalization  fallacy  reverse  fallacy  accident  occurs  one  forms  general  rule  examining  specific  cases  representative  possible  cases  example  jim  bakker  insincere  christian  therefore  christians  insincere  sweeping  generalization  dicto  simpliciter  sweeping  generalization  occurs  general  rule  applied  particular  situation  features  particular  situation  render  rule  inapplicable  sweeping  generalization  opposite  hasty  generalization  non  causa  pro  causa  post  hoc  ergo  propter  hoc  known  false  cause  fallacies  fallacy  non  causa  pro  causa  occurs  one  identifies  something  cause  event  actually  shown  cause  example  took  aspirin  prayed  god  headache  disappeared  god  cured  headache  fallacy  post  hoc  ergo  propter  hoc  occurs  something  assumed  cause  event  merely  happened  event  example  soviet  union  collapsed  taking  atheism  therefore  must  avoid  atheism  reasons  cum  hoc  ergo  propter  hoc  fallacy  similar  post  hoc  ergo  propter  hoc  asserts  two  events  occur  together  must  causally  related  leaves  room  factors  may  cause  events  petitio  principii  fallacy  occurs  premises  least  questionable  conclusion  reached  circulus  demonstrando  fallacy  occurs  one  assumes  premise  conclusion  one  wishes  reach  often  proposition  rephrased  fallacy  appears  valid  argument  example  homosexuals  must  allowed  hold  government  office  hence  government  official  revealed  homosexual  lose  job  therefore  homosexuals  anything  hide  secret  open  blackmail  therefore  homosexuals  cannot  allowed  hold  government  office  note  argument  entirely  circular  premise  conclusion  argument  like  actually  cited  reason  british  secret  services  official  ban  homosexual  employees  another  example  classic  know  god  exists  bible  tells  us  know  bible  true  word  god  complex  question  fallacy  interrogation  fallacy  presupposition  one  example  classic  loaded  question  stopped  beating  wife  question  presupposes  definite  answer  another  question  even  asked  trick  often  used  lawyers  cross  examination  ask  questions  like  hide  money  stole  similarly  politicians  often  ask  loaded  questions  long  ec  interference  affairs  allowed  continue  chancellor  plan  two  years  ruinous  privatization  ignoratio  elenchi  fallacy  irrelevant  conclusion  consists  claiming  argument  supports  particular  conclusion  actually  logically  nothing  conclusion  example  christian  may  begin  saying  argue  teachings  christianity  undoubtably  true  argues  length  christianity  great  help  many  people  matter  well  argues  shown  christian  teachings  true  sadly  fallacious  arguments  often  successful  arouse  emotions  cause  others  view  supposed  conclusion  favourable  light  equivocation  equivocation  occurs  key  word  used  two  different  meanings  argument  example  could  affordable  free  software  make  sure  remains  free  users  like  must  place  license  make  sure  always  freely  redistributable  amphiboly  amphiboly  occurs  premises  used  argument  ambiguous  careless  ungrammatical  phrasing  accent  accent  another  form  fallacy  shifting  meaning  case  meaning  changed  altering  parts  statement  emphasized  example  consider  speak  ill  friends  speak  ill  friends  fallacies  composition  one  fallacy  composition  conclude  property  shared  parts  something  must  apply  whole  example  bicycle  made  entirely  low  mass  components  therefore  lightweight  fallacy  composition  conclude  property  number  individual  items  shared  collection  items  example  car  uses  less  petrol  causes  less  pollution  bus  therefore  cars  less  environmentally  damaging  buses  fallacy  division  fallacy  division  opposite  fallacy  composition  like  opposite  exists  two  varieties  first  assume  property  thing  must  apply  parts  example  studying  rich  college  therefore  must  rich  assume  property  collection  items  shared  item  example  ants  destroy  tree  therefore  ant  destroy  tree  slippery  slope  argument  argument  states  one  event  occur  harmful  events  proof  made  harmful  events  caused  first  event  example  legalize  marijuana  would  legalize  crack  heroin  nation  full  drug  addicts  welfare  therefore  cannot  legalize  marijuana  based  b  fallacies  type  fallacies  fallacies  occur  one  attempts  argue  things  way  similar  without  actually  specifying  way

argument  form  b  therefore  b  argumentum  ad  antiquitam  fallacy  asserting  something  right  good  simply  old  way  always  argumentum  ad  novitam  opposite  argumentum  ad  antiquitam  fallacy  asserting  something  correct  simply  new  newer  something  else  argumentum  ad  crumenam  fallacy  believing  money  criterion  correctness  money  likely  right  argumentum  ad  lazarum  fallacy  assuming  someone  poor  sounder  virtuous  one  wealthier  fallacy  opposite  argumentum  ad  crumenam  argumentum  ad  nauseam  incorrect  belief  assertion  likely  true  often  heard
